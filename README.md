# Quant Research & Computational Finance
**Independent Quantitative Analyst & Researcher**

Welcome to my research repository. This space serves as a collection of curiosity-driven notebooks exploring the mathematical foundations of financial markets, derivative pricing, and risk management. 

My approach to quantitative finance is rooted in the belief that **geometry beats algebra**. To truly understand a model, one must visualize the underlying mechanics of uncertainty. These notebooks represent my journey into translating abstract stochastic calculus into intuitive, actionable insights.

## 🛠 Philosophy & Methodology
- **Probability First:** Markets are not just numbers; they are evolving probability distributions.
- **Visual Intuition:** I prioritize "plotting first and formalizing last" to reveal the hidden structures of risk.
- **Conceptual Rigor:** Beyond the Black-Scholes formulas, I explore the *why*—from Brownian motion to the "cliff effects" of Greeks near expiration.

## 📚 Featured Research Notebooks

### 1. [From Probability to Price: A Visual Journey](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/blob/main/probability_to_price.ipynb)
An exploration of the stochastic foundations of option pricing.
* **Focus:** Moving from Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) and lognormal distributions to the Black-Scholes-Merton model.
* **Key Insight:** Deconstructing $d_1$ and $d_2$ to show how uncertainty transforms into present value.

### 2. [Analysis of Option Greeks & Sensitivities](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/blob/main/Greek_Sensitivities.ipynb)
A technical study of risk surfaces and how they react to market shifts.
* **Focus:** Delta, Gamma, Theta, and Vega sensitivities.
* **Key Insight:** Visualizing how volatility "flattens" risk and how time decay accelerates as we approach maturity.

### 3. [Strategic Payoff Architecture](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/blob/main/Strategies.ipynb)
A comparative analysis of multi-leg option and stock strategies.
* **Focus:** P&L profiles for Covered Calls, Iron Condors, Straddles, and Spreads.
* **Key Insight:** Mapping market regimes (trending vs. range-bound) to specific mathematical payoff structures.

## 🚀 Current Research Directions
While these foundational works focus on traditional derivative frameworks, my current research is expanding into:
* **Crypto-Asset Volatility:** Analyzing the unique "Skew" and "Smile" patterns in BTC/ETH markets.
* **AI & Forecasting:** Leveraging machine learning to predict volatility regimes.
* **Dynamic Hedging:** Simulating delta-neutral strategies under real-world friction and slippage.
